## Introduction

Today, I began by recreating the component I built yesterday, which you can view [here](http://127.0.0.1:4000/deliberate-practise-ux/ux-practice/2024/08/17/creating-a-deliberate-practice-component.html). The goal was to reinforce the concepts I learned, and I’m pleased to report that I retained most of them. However, there were a few areas where I had to refer back to my previous solution.

### CSS Concepts for Further Practice

As I recreated the component, I realized I need more practice with the following CSS concepts:

- **`relative` & `absolute` with `left-3` & `top-3`**: These were crucial for positioning the close button ("X") at the top left of the card. I also learned about using the HTML entity `&#10005;` for the "X" symbol.
- **`space-y-3`**: This utility was essential for adding consistent spacing between the buttons.
- **`bg-[#0066ff]`**: I used this syntax to apply a specific color to the buttons. It’s a handy way to ensure consistency in your design.
- **`hover:text-gray-600`**: Adding this hover effect provided immediate visual feedback, enhancing the interactivity of the buttons.

### Next Steps

My next step will be to create a new component today, continuing my journey of deliberate practice.

See you again soon!
