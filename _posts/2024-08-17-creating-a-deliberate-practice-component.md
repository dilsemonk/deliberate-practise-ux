## Introduction

Deliberate practice is all about focused, intentional effort to improve specific skills. In my journey to master UX design, I'm dedicating myself to building and refining UI components daily. As someone who struggles with UX, I want to document my journey to learn the underlying techniques through repetition. My hope is that after building hundreds of these components, I'll finally experience that “Aha!” moment.

### Today's Challenge: Building a Card Component

Today, I attempted to build a card component. I started with a design, modified it to suit my needs, and then built it from scratch using Tailwind CSS. This process helped me explore fundamental UX concepts like visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography.

### Key UX Observations

During this exercise, I made several observations that are important to remember for future projects:

#### 1. Centered Content
Centering the content creates a balanced layout and draws the user's attention to the core message. This practice improves **readability** and **focus**.

#### 2. Visual Hierarchy with Font Weight
Using a darker font for "Hello!" compared to the following text establishes a clear visual hierarchy. This helps guide the user's eyes from the most important information to the supporting details.

#### 3. Generous Button Padding
The buttons are centered and have ample padding on the left and right, which enhances **clickability** and makes the interface more **user-friendly**.

#### 4. Consistent Spacing Between Buttons
Maintaining consistent spacing between buttons improves the overall **layout structure** and ensures a clean, uncluttered interface.

#### 5. Prominent Call to Action
The 3rd button, styled in blue, stands out as the primary call to action (CTA). This use of color indicates a default action and encourages user interaction.

#### 6. Subtle Secondary Text
The smaller font at the bottom of the card ensures that secondary information is visible but not overwhelming. Highlighting specific text draws attention to key points without distracting from the main message.

### Tailwind CSS Concepts by Theme

As I built this component, I discovered several key Tailwind CSS classes that contribute to different aspects of UX design. Here’s how they enhance the component:

#### 1. Layout and Positioning
Effective layout and positioning are crucial for creating a balanced and responsive design.

- **`flex`**: Enables a flexbox layout, making it easier to create responsive designs.
- **`h-screen`**: Ensures the component takes up the full height of the viewport, which is key for vertical centering.
- **`items-center` & `justify-center`**: Centering elements both vertically and horizontally improves user focus and readability.
- **`relative` & `absolute`**: These classes help in precisely positioning elements within their containers, essential for adding icons or buttons.
- **`left-3` & `top-3`**: These classes control the exact placement of elements within the layout.

#### 2. Sizing and Spacing
Proper sizing and spacing are fundamental to creating a visually appealing and accessible design.

- **`w-full` & `max-w-md`**: These classes ensure the component scales properly across different screen sizes.
- **`p-8`, `px-4`, `pb-2`, `mt-6`, `space-y-3`, `py-3`**: Consistent padding and margins improve the layout structure and make the design more user-friendly.

#### 3. Color and Background
Using color strategically enhances visual hierarchy and user engagement.

- **`bg-slate-200` & `bg-white`**: These background colors create a clean, modern look that supports readability.
- **`text-gray-400`, `text-gray-800`**: Different shades of gray help create a hierarchy, guiding the user’s attention.
- **`bg-[#0066ff]`**: The custom blue background color for the CTA button grabs attention, encouraging interaction.
- **`hover:text-gray-600`**: Adding a hover effect provides immediate feedback, enhancing interactivity.

#### 4. Typography
Typography is essential for setting the tone of the interface and ensuring readability.

- **`font-sans`**: The sans-serif font gives the component a modern, clean appearance.
- **`text-3xl`, `font-bold`, `text-xs`**: These classes adjust font size and weight to create a clear visual hierarchy.
- **`text-center`**: Centering text contributes to a balanced, harmonious layout.

### Next Steps

As I continue this journey, my next step will be to explore more complex components that challenge my understanding of layout, typography, and interactivity. Tomorrow, I plan to focus on [potential next focus area, e.g., creating a responsive navigation bar or improving form accessibility].

See you tomorrow!
